# **World Development Indicators**
This project was conducted by [Aaron Ginder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-ginder-2aa372127/)

## **Purpose**
To provide current, easily interpretable visualisations of world development factors for public citizens so that they can be informed of how economic and social affairs have changed over time and vary by country.

## **Scope**
### <u>In scope</u>:

* Experiment using visualisation software, applications and packages including Tableau and Python (matplotlib)

* To use a readily available API for scheduled, automated data collection on a yearly basis

* To provide a consumable product that end-users can use. For example, an interactive dashboard in Tableau, a report in Jupyter Notebook or Sphinx

* Automated emailing functionality of the latest world development statistics

### <u>Outside scope</u>:

* Pre-processing of data involving cleaning and joining of datasets to create a flat, tabular output that will be ingested

* Testing of the data source feed into the data pipeline such as checking the number of rows change during every pipeline run

* Bespoke, predictive analysis to decipher future patterns of outside of the Tableau predictive analytics packages (eg. Bayesian modelling, neural networks, classification models)

## **Data Sources**
* [World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/the-world-bank/wdi?filter=solution-type:dataset&filter=category:economics&id=8617f452-5015-4bed-b289-890b50f30cbc) provided by The World Bank and hosted by Google BigQuery
